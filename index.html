  <h3>Career Goals</h3>
<p>My career goals are to focus more on design and less on marketing. Iâ€™m reading about Figma and UX/UI as I want to be a visual designer. I would love to be in a position that uses my creative skills in a hybrid or remote office. I also want to be compensated appropriately for my work, as in my last position, I was severely underpaid.</p>
